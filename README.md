# Web Project 4

## Around the U.S.

This is a picture sharing website, created as my first project using JavaScript -- hopefully I continue to get better at it =S.

### This webpage was made using

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- (For the first time) OOP!
- BEM methodology
- Webpack and various webpack associated plugins for autoprefixing, image processing, and similar processes.
- an API

### Changes made

- Added ability to focus on specific images
- Added ability to add cards - <form> and function
- added likebutton functionality
- added ability to delete cards
- restructured and refactored code into OOP
- created webpack
- added API utility! - No longer resets entirely on reload! :)

### Future changes
